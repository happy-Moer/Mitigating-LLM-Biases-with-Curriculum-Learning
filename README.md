# Mitigating-LLM-Biases-with-Curriculum-Learning
Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit biases learned from their training data, mirroring societal stereotypes or imbalances. Curriculum learning – training a model on data in a purposeful order (typically from “easy” or less complex examples to harder ones) – is emerging as a strategy to address these biases​. By carefully sequencing training or fine-tuning steps, curriculum learning can guide LLMs to develop more fair and robust representations before confronting the full complexity (and potential biases) of massive datasets. Below, we discuss methodologies for applying curriculum learning to mitigate bias, recent research advances, and how this approach contributes to fairness, robustness, and ethical AI development.
